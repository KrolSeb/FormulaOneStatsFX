## General info

This project was a final project of Java programming classes at the university. 
I wanted to learn GUI basics in Java and use acquired knowledge in a practical project.

In this project I used Ergast Developer API implementation in Java:
https://github.com/olerom/formula-one-ergast

## Technologies

- Java 8
- Java FX
- Maven

## Setup

Requirement: Java 8 SDK, installed on your computer.

Clone this repository via IntelliJ IDEA startup menu. IDE should recognize all dependencies and download them automatically. Build project and run via Main class.

## Features

List of features ready:

- usage of the API mentioned in the General Info section to obtain the property data,
- 5 main views that shows retrieved data about drivers, constructors, tracks and races, 
- separate view used to save favourite data by user,
- saving and reading data via serialization technique,
- saving data to text file and reading data from saved file.

## Status

The basic version of a project has been **completed**. 
In the future I want to create my custom implementation of retrieving data from API (the one I used causes errors in my application).
